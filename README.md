# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews

This NLP project explores sentiment classification using movie reviews. We build a full pipeline using text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and two classification models: Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

---

## 📁 Datasets
- ✅ Sample toy dataset
- ✅ Synthetic IMDB dataset (1000+ reviews)
- ✅ Real IMDB dataset (500 reviews, clean & balanced)

---

## 🧪 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest

---

## 📊 Results Summary
- **Toy dataset:** Too small for meaningful evaluation
- **Synthetic data:** Inconsistent performance
- **Real IMDB:** 100% accuracy using both models

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Preprocessing is critical for good results
- TF-IDF can be powerful even with simple models
- Data quality matters more than size

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, TF-IDF
- Colab for execution

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Colab
3. Upload the required `.csv` files (if needed)
4. Run all cells
